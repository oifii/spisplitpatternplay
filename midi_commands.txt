MIDI DOS commandline utilities
Hint 	You need some DOS knowledge to use following DOS commandline tools inside MS-DOS box (cmd.exe). The DOS utilities work only in 32bit Windows versions or using a DOS 16 bit emulator in Windows 7 64bit (e.g. dosbox or XP mode). There are many good tutorials about learning DOS commandline in internet available e.g. http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial76.html. Running the commandline utilities does not require midiio.zip . The DOS utilities are not developed further.
