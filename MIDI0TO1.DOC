		   midi binary format 0 to 1

		  (info@gnmidi.com)
		******************************

[0] FEATURES
    + reads a binary midi file of format 0 (needs to be valid)
    + writes a binary midi files of format 1 
    + splits all tracks of input into separate track 
    + creates a leading tempo track and a track for each used channel (1-16)

[1] BACKGROUND
Midi format 0 contains only one track. Midi format 1 contains a tempo track 
and one or more singlechannel tracks that should be played together. 
Midi format 1 files are easier to modify (e.g. with MIDI2TXT/TXT2MIDI)
because the channel jumping operator [##] is not needed. Midi format 1
files are printed using MIDI2TXT as
  MTrk($A)
   ...
  end Mtrk

Use MIDI2TXT -i to show the version of midi file.

[5] INSTALLATION

[MSDOS]
Simply copy MIDI0TO1.EXE in a directory that is in your path.
When you start the program without arguments

C:\> MIDI0TO1

you should get the usage text (see next section)

[6] USAGE

usage: MIDI0TO1 srcfile.mid destfile.mid

MIDI0TO1 does not convert files that are not of format 0!
In this case the program prints the version and exits.

Warning: MIDI0TO1 does not warn about overwriting existing destfile.mid !

M0TO1.BAT:
    This DOS batch file makes conversion of one or more midi files easier.

    Simply start it in a directory containing midi files (*.mid). 
    It generates a new subdirectory RESULT containing
    converted files and copies of all files that were not convertable 
    (e.g. already format 1, or corrupt).

[9] USE
For example, you have a midi file example0.mid that you expect to be format 0.

MIDI0TO1 example0.mid example1.mid

If it is a format 2 midi, the program will stop with a message like that:
   "example0.mid is format 2. This program does not convert it to 0."

If it is a format 1 midi, the program will stop with a message like that:
   "example1.mid is already format 1"

If it is a format 0 midi, it will try to split the track into example1.mid:
  23%  (counting from 0 to 100)
  "output written to example1.mid"

convert all midi files (*.mid) in a directory:

cd \midis
M1TO0
cd result
dir *.mid

Hint: if you want to convert only a list of certain files then make a 
new directory and copy these files into the directory and start M1TO0 in it.

Hint: Use midifmt to list the midi files with their format info.

[10] CHANGES
v1.0 to v1.1:
  * used updated midiio 
  * when converting midi files containing many tracks (e.g. 130) a message
    "assert failed ..." ocurred because of not enough memory 
    changed assert into error message "out of memory" and compiled in large
    memory model to access more memory.

v1.1 to v1.2:
  * prevent of producing empty file if format of input mid is not 0.
  * batch file m0to1.bat included. 

v1.2 to v1.3
  * supporting long events (sysex, meta larger than 1 kb)

v1.3 to v1.4
  * help for users that cannot use DOS utilities
